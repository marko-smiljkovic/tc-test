* run the server - python manage.py runserver

Running the the_bot
* python the_bot.py

TODO - possibly change hunterio key, since I spammed this one a lot, and got over the amount of requests I have 

P.S. I do know its not safe to keep keys like hunterio and clearbit in conf, and use env vars instead, but should be easier to run like this!
